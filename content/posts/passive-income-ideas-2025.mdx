## What Is Passive Income?

Passive income is **money earned on autopilot** after an initial time, money, or energy investment.

It’s not magic. It requires effort upfront—but once it's running, it can keep earning while you focus on other things.

### Examples:

- Earning dividends from stocks
- Renting out digital products
- Getting royalties from books or music
- Making money from ads on content you created months ago

> The goal is **leverage**—using time or capital once to create repeat income forever.

## 1. Start a Niche Blog (and Monetize With Ads & Affiliates)

Starting a blog is still one of the **most underrated passive income machines**—if you treat it like a long-term investment.

### Why it works:

- Blogs rank on Google for years
- You can monetize with **Google AdSense**, **PropellerAds**, or **Mediavine**
- Affiliate links bring commission for every sale you refer

### Example:

Start a blog about “minimalist home workouts.” Write 30 high-quality SEO articles. Place ads and Amazon affiliate links. Once traffic grows, it can earn money even if you stop posting.

#### Tools:

- [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) or [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/)
- Domain + hosting (~€30–€80/year)
- Google Search Console for indexing

💡 Trustixo is built on this exact model.

## 2. Sell Digital Products

Digital products are **products you make once and sell forever**. No shipping, no inventory.

### Ideas:

- Notion templates
- Resume/CV templates
- Ebooks
- Excel calculators
- Budget trackers
- Lightroom presets

Sell on:

- **Gumroad**
- **Ko-fi**
- **Etsy**
- Your own site (with Stripe)

With the right topic and marketing, a €15 template can sell thousands of times passively.

## 3. Invest in Dividend Stocks or ETFs

Dividend investing is one of the most **true forms of passive income**.

Buy shares of a company or fund that pays regular dividends (typically quarterly). These are **profits shared with shareholders**, and you don’t have to do anything except hold them.

### Examples:

- **VUSA** (S&P 500 ETF) – low fees, regular dividends
- **iShares Dividend UCITS** (IDVY)
- Blue-chip stocks like **Coca-Cola**, **PepsiCo**, **Unilever**

### Strategy:

- Use **Degiro**, **Trade Republic**, or **Revolut** to buy
- Reinvest dividends to grow faster
- Aim for **3–6% annual yield**

Even €5,000 invested in a 5% dividend stock = €250/year, forever.

## 4. License Your Photography or Art

If you're good with a camera, you can turn your creativity into passive money.

### How:

- Upload your photos to platforms like:
  - **Shutterstock**
  - **Adobe Stock**
  - **Unsplash+ (paid)**
  - **EyeEm**

You earn royalties every time someone downloads your photo for commercial use.

This also applies to **AI-generated images**, digital art, and even product mockups.

---

## 5. Rent Out Space or Stuff

This is physical passive income—you own something and rent it out.

### Ideas:

- **Garage, parking space, or storage unit**
- **Quad or jet ski** in tourist season
- **Photography gear or drones**
- **Car (via Getaround)**

If you live in a city like **Zagreb** or **Split**, space is valuable.

Example: Rent out your unused parking spot for €50/month = €600/year.

---

## 6. Create a YouTube Channel

YouTube is one of the best long-term passive income platforms.

Videos uploaded today can still make you money years later via:

- **Ad revenue (Google AdSense)**
- **Affiliate links in the description**
- **Sponsorships**
- **Product sales**

### Niche ideas:

- Tutorials (e.g. Excel, investing, tech)
- Silent study videos
- Finance explainers
- Gaming walkthroughs
- AI tools

You don’t even need to show your face—**faceless channels** are growing rapidly.

---

## 7. Build a Simple SaaS or Automation Tool

Software as a Service (SaaS) products are passive-income goldmines if built well.

It can be something as simple as:

- A Chrome extension
- A PDF merger tool
- A social media scheduler
- A budgeting calculator

Host it with low-cost services like **Vercel**, **Supabase**, or **Firebase** and charge a monthly fee.

No-code tools like **Bubble**, **Tally**, and **Webflow** let you build without knowing how to code.

## How to Choose the Right Passive Income Stream

Ask yourself:

- How much **time** can I invest upfront?
- Do I have any **skills** I can monetize (design, writing, coding)?
- How much **capital** can I start with?
- Do I want something **digital or physical**?

### Low money, high time? → Blogging, YouTube, affiliate links

### High money, low time? → Dividend investing, real estate, storage rental

### Creative? → Digital templates, stock photos, eBooks

---

## How Much Can You Earn?

Here’s what a realistic passive income portfolio might look like after 1 year:

- Blog with ads/affiliate: **€150/month**
- Dividend stocks: **€30/month**
- YouTube channel: **€100/month**
- Digital products (Gumroad): **€75/month**
- Parking space rental: **€50/month**

**Total: €405/month** = €4,860/year

And these numbers can scale fast over time.

## Passive ≠ Effortless

Passive income is often marketed like magic. The truth?

> You’ll probably work **harder up front** than any regular job. But the reward is freedom later.

Be prepared to:

- Research and test ideas
- Fail a couple of times
- Iterate your content/products
- Promote on Reddit, TikTok, Twitter, etc.

But once it works? You make money while you sleep.

---

## Final Thoughts: Start Small, Think Long-Term

Passive income is **not about quitting your job tomorrow**. It's about building a system where **your money or content works for you**.

Start with one income stream. Make your first €1. Then scale from there.

Consistency beats perfection.
