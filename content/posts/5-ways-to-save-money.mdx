In today‚Äôs fast-paced world, managing your finances has never been more important. Whether you're saving for a big purchase, an emergency fund, or financial freedom, developing consistent money-saving habits can dramatically improve your long-term wealth.

At **Trustixo**, we believe that smart financial decisions start with small changes. This guide breaks down **five effective ways to save more money every month**‚Äîno drastic sacrifices, just smarter habits that add up.

Let‚Äôs dive in.

## 1. Automate Your Savings: Set It and Forget It

One of the most powerful habits you can build is **paying yourself first**‚Äîautomatically.

Instead of saving what‚Äôs left at the end of the month, **move money into savings the moment your income hits your account**. This method ensures saving becomes a non-negotiable part of your monthly routine.

### How to get started:

- Set up an **automatic transfer** from your main bank account to a savings account.
- Choose a realistic amount (even ‚Ç¨50/month is enough to start).
- Use banks or apps that allow for automation, like **Revolut**, **N26**, or **Monese**.
- Consider using separate savings "buckets" for different goals: vacation, emergency, investment, etc.

> ‚ÄúSaving should be automatic, not optional. Automation makes discipline unnecessary.‚Äù ‚Äî Trustixo Team

You can also try round-up saving apps, where every purchase is rounded up to the nearest euro and the difference is deposited into savings.

### Example:

Spend ‚Ç¨3.60 on coffee ‚Üí ‚Ç¨0.40 automatically saved.

By using automation, you remove friction and make saving money consistent‚Äîeven on low income.

## 2. Audit and Cancel Unused Subscriptions

Streaming services, forgotten gym memberships, old app subscriptions‚Äî**they add up fast**.

According to a 2024 EU consumer study, the average person spends over **‚Ç¨500/year** on subscriptions they don‚Äôt use. That‚Äôs over **‚Ç¨40/month** being silently drained from your account.

### What to do:

- Log into your bank or use a budgeting app (like **Emma**, **MoneyWiz**, or **Revolut Insights**) to review monthly recurring charges.
- Ask yourself: **‚ÄúDid I use this in the past month?‚Äù** If not, cancel it.
- Replace overlapping services. If you use Netflix and Disney+, do you really need both?

**Helpful tools:**

- **Bobby** (iOS/Android) ‚Äì manually track subscriptions
- **Truebill** or **Rocket Money** ‚Äì automatically detect and cancel
- **Revolut Premium** ‚Äì gives subscription tracking and insights

### Pro tip:

Re-check subscriptions every quarter. Services love to quietly increase prices after 6‚Äì12 months.

## 3. Earn Cashback on Everyday Spending

If you‚Äôre not using **cashback cards**, you‚Äôre leaving free money on the table.

Cashback and rewards programs are a passive way to **save 1‚Äì5%** on purchases you‚Äôre already making. Over a year, this could add up to **hundreds of euros**, especially if you shop online or travel often.

### Best Cashback Options in Europe

- **Revolut Metal** ‚Äì Offers 0.1% to 1% cashback depending on your plan tier. Higher-tier users earn more and get additional perks like airport lounges.
- **Curve Cash** ‚Äì Gives 1% cashback at up to 3 selected retailers, even on the free plan. Great if you shop frequently at the same places.
- **American Express Blue** ‚Äì Earns 1% to 2% in points, which can be redeemed for rewards or statement credit. Ideal for consistent spending.
- **Vivid Money** ‚Äì Offers between 0.5% and 10% cashback on partner brands. Perfect for those who want high returns from regular purchases.

### Where to use cashback:

- Groceries
- Fuel
- Online shopping (Amazon, AliExpress)
- Subscriptions
- Travel bookings

> Tip: Use your cashback card for **all fixed monthly bills**, then pay off the balance in full. Never carry a balance‚Äîyou'll lose more in interest than you gain in rewards.

## 4. Master Grocery Budgeting

Food is one of the biggest flexible expenses‚Äîand one of the easiest to optimize. Without a plan, you‚Äôll overspend on snacks, waste fresh produce, or fall into costly takeout traps.

### Step-by-step to save on groceries:

1. **Plan your meals weekly**: Decide what you‚Äôll eat before shopping.
2. **Use a shopping list**: Stick to essentials, avoid impulse buys.
3. **Shop on a full stomach**: Shopping hungry leads to overspending.
4. **Use discount apps**: In Croatia, apps like **Too Good To Go**, **KupiMe**, and **Letgo** offer significant food discounts and surplus deals.
5. **Buy store brands**: Most are made in the same factories as premium brands.

### Bonus hacks:

- Cook in bulk and freeze portions.
- Always compare unit prices (‚Ç¨/kg or ‚Ç¨/L).
- Visit markets close to closing time for price drops.

> ‚ÄúSaving money doesn‚Äôt mean eating poorly. It means shopping smarter and wasting less.‚Äù

Even cutting ‚Ç¨15‚Äì‚Ç¨25 per week on food adds up to **‚Ç¨780‚Äì‚Ç¨1,300 per year**.

## 5. Build a Simple Side Hustle

If your income is limited, you can only cut expenses so far. That‚Äôs why **adding even a small side income** can accelerate your savings dramatically.

### Easy side hustles for beginners (EU-friendly):

#### Freelance online:

- Offer services like writing, design, translation, or virtual assistant work on **Fiverr**, **Upwork**, or **Malt**.

#### Affiliate marketing:

- Build a niche blog (like Trustixo!) and recommend tools or products via **affiliate links**.
- Example: Finance, fitness, travel, or tech content monetized with **FinanceAds**, **Impact**, or **CJ Affiliate**.

#### Sell digital products:

- Create and sell ebooks, templates, or Notion trackers on **Gumroad** or **Ko-fi**.

#### Resell items:

- Flip secondhand electronics, clothes, or books using **Nju≈°kalo**, **OLX**, or **Facebook Marketplace**.

#### Bonus idea: Remote customer support jobs

- Many companies hire part-time remote reps to handle chat or email support. Pays ‚Ç¨8‚Äì‚Ç¨15/hour depending on language skills.
